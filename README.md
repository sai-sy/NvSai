# TODO
- [ ] arrow key navigation rolls across lines
- [ ] shift tab indent
- [ ] telescope no live preview
- [ ] cntrl right at the start of the last word on a line does not go to the end of the word, instead it goes to the start of the next line
- [ ] telescope.lua cntrl shift f should be grep but there's something else there instead
